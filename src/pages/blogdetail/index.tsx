                                        <p>In the 50th game of the IPL 2023, Phil Salt, a dangerous batter, demonstrated the full extent of his abilities by smashing 87 off just 45 balls. His efforts helped DC defeat RCB handily, and his stunning knock earned him the title of "Player of the Match." Swiss watches online shop with various perfect super clone watches. Fast shipping.

                                        <p>After the game, Salt revealed that they had discussed being upbeat and facing the game head-on before it. He continued by saying that when he gets off to a strong start, he has the ability to persevere. He added that because the pitch was so sluggish and low, DC batters understood they could slow down in the middle overs.</p>

We saw how good they were in Bangalore when they had their tails up.The real strength of mine is when I get going I don't really look to take my foot off the pedal too often.

                                        <p>He also thought that RCB reached a par score and knew that they needed to bat well, which they did. Additionally, he complimented Marsh's batting technique and said that Marsh's six off the second ball put the bowlers immediately on the defensive. The support DC is receiving at the Arun Jaitley Stadium is something Salt praised the supporters for. He also noted that there weren't many RCB supporters present for this game.</p>
